# `ezmodel`

## Introduction

## Overview

`ezmodel` simplifies web application state management. It provides a clear API for both local and global states, making your code cleaner and more maintainable.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Using `npm`

```bash
npm i ezmodel
```

Using `yarn`

```bash
yarn add ezmodel
```

### Quick Start Guide

Wrap components with `view()`, define states with `model()` and using `effect()` to detect model change.

```js
import { model, effect } from "ezmodel";
import { view } from "ezmodel/react";

const counter = model({ count: 0 });

effect(() => {
  console.log("count", counter.count);
});

const App = view(() => (
  <button onClick={() => counter.count++}>{counter.count}</button>
));
```

## Features

- **Ease of Use:** Straightforward setup.
- **Reactivity:** Seamless state-to-UI binding.
- **Performance:** Optimized for efficiency.

<summary>Defining model methods</summary>

Use object shorthand syntax to define model methods.

```js
import { model } from "ezmodel";

const app = model({
  count: 1,
  increment() {
    this.count++;
  },
  incrementBy(by) {
    this.count += by;
  },
});
```

<summary>Defining model computed properties</summary>

Computed properties are object properties that contain expressions with reactive dependencies on model properties or other computed properties. When any of these reactive dependencies are updated, the computed properties will automatically re-calculate. This implies that computed properties will be memoized, allowing for efficient subsequent access.

```js
import { model } from "ezmodel";

const module1 = model({ value: 1 });
const module2 = model({ value: 2 });
const module3 = model({
  factor: 2,
  // computed properties
  get sum() {
    return (
      // internal reactive value
      this.factor *
      // external reactive values
      (module1.value + module2.value)
    );
  },
});

console.log(module3.sum); // 6
console.log(module3.sum); // the module3.sum is invoked once
module1.value++; // the module3.sum re-computes
module2.value++; // the module3.sum re-computes
module3.factor++; // the module3.sum re-computes
```

<summary>Using immutable data for mutating model</summary>

Similar to other state management libraries, `ezmodel` enforces the use of immutable data when mutating model properties.

```js
import { model } from "ezmodel";

const app = model({
  todos: [],
});

// ðŸ”´ DON'T
app.todos.push({ title: "new todo" });

// ðŸŸ¢ DO
app.todos = [...app.todos, { title: "new todo" }];
```

To simplify the mutation of nested objects, the `alter` function can be utilized. This function operates similarly to the "produce" function of Immer, but it possesses additional characteristics.

```js
import { model, alter } from "ezmodel";

const app = model({
  count: 0,
  modifiedAt: undefined,
  todos: [],
  addTodo(title) {
    // If a mutation function is passed, all model accesses are drafted by Immer.
    alter(() => {
      // mutate an array
      this.todos.push({ title });
      // we also can do mutation on multiple models at once
      otherModel.todos.push({ title });
    });

    // Alternatively, a mutation map can be passed, which has the same structure as the model properties.
    alter(this, {
      modifiedAt: new Date(),
      // return a new value
      count: (prev) => prev + 1,
      // mutate draft object
      todos: (todos) => {
        todos.push({ title });
      },
    });
  },
});
```

<summary>Defining validation rules for model</summary>
`Ezmodel` supports validation rules that allow you to validate your model data according to your own criteria. While the following code may function in standard scenarios, implementing validation rules can enhance its effectiveness.

```js
import { model } from "ezmodel";

const app = model({
  count: 1,
  setCount(value) {
    if (isNaN(value)) {
      throw new Error("Invalid count");
    }
  },
});
```

The improved version of the code, which incorporates validation rules, appears more straightforward and reusable.

```js
import { model } from "ezmodel";

const isNumber = (value) => {
  if (isNaN(value)) {
    throw new Error(`Expected number but got ${typeof value}`);
  }
};

const app = model(
  { count: 1 },
  {
    rules: {
      count: isNumber,
    },
  }
);

app.count = "aaa"; // an error thrown `Expected number but got string`
```

You can also utilize third-party validation libraries to meet your requirements. Check the example below to demonstrate integration with `zod`.

```js
import { z } from "zod";
import { model } from "ezmodel";

const app = model(
  { count: 1 },
  {
    rules: {
      count: z.number(),
    },
  }
);
```

`Ezmodel` also supports performing data transformation and validation together.

```js
import { z } from "zod";
import { model } from "ezmodel";

const app = model(
  { count: 1 },
  {
    rules: {
      count: z.coerce.number().min(1),
    },
  }
);

// try to assign string instead number and zod will convert the value to number and does validation
app.count = "2";
expect(app.count).toBe(2);
```
